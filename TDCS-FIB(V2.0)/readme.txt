	1) Operating environment: it is recommended to use Matlab2014 or advanced version;
	2) The working directory location: the path name cannot have a space character, Chinese characters and special characters. For example, the executable file with a path name ¡®C: \TDCS-FIB\CRH2.exe¡¯ can run, but the one with ¡®C:\ TDCS FIB\CRH2.exe¡¯ not, because the path name contains a space character.
