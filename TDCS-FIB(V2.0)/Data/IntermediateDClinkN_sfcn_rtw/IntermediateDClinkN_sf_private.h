/*
 * IntermediateDClinkN_sf_private.h
 *
 * Code generation for model "IntermediateDClinkN_sf".
 *
 * Model version              : 1.162
 * Simulink Coder version : 8.6 (R2014a) 27-Dec-2013
 * C source code generated on : Fri Jul 21 16:25:25 2017
 *
 * Target selection: rtwsfcn.tlc
 * Note: GRT includes extra infrastructure and instrumentation for prototyping
 * Embedded hardware selection: Generic->Custom
 * Emulation hardware selection:
 *    Differs from embedded hardware (MATLAB Host)
 * Code generation objectives: Unspecified
 * Validation result: Not run
